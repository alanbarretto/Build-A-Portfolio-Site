# Build a Portfolio Website Project

Build a Portfolio Website Project is a fully responsive webpage based on a mockup that showcases the different projects the 
developer has done. The Webpage has no real projects yet, and instead has various images and text as placeholders. The only 
valid information is the name of the developer at the top of the page.
